/**Modules must be listed in the order that they are to be unpacked. 
 * (Be sure to continue the define line with the '\' character.)
 * If multiple modules of the same type are used a line for each
 * module is required. See modules/include for available modules.
 * The predefine is read by cmake to build a library specific to
 * each implementation and created a vector of pointers to the
 * ReadEvent() methods of each module class.
 * 
 * New modules can be added with the following required prototype:
 * \code 
 * ReadEvent(nsclBuffer*,eventData*,bool)
 * \endcode
 * See modules/include for examples.
